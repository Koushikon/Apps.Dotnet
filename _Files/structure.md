# Repository Structure

*Note:* Some projects may fit into multiple categories. In those cases, refer to the [Master Index](#master-index) for keyword tags that offer additional cross-referencing.


## Master Index

Below is a table that provides a quick overview of each project along with its category and keywords. Use the keywords to filter or search within your IDE or file explorer.

| **Project Name** | **Category** | **Keywords** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RazorWeb_I | MVC and Razor | razor, MVC, web | A sample Razor-based web project. |
| Todo-App | Application Samples | todo, CRUD, application | A complete Todo application sample. |
| Entity-Framework | DataAccess | Entity Framework, data access, ORM | Examples of data access using EF Core. |
| DapperWithApi | DataAccess | Dapper, API, micro-ORM | Demonstrates using Dapper with an API. |
| Blazor-Features | Blazor | Blazor, components, SPA | Examples of Blazor features and components. |

*Feel free to expand this table as you add new projects. The above list is an example; you can include more columns (e.g., repository path or last updated date) if needed.*


## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain consistency and ease of navigation:

1. **Naming Conventions:**  
   - Use clear, descriptive names for new projects.
   - Prefix projects with relevant identifiers (e.g., `Crud_`, `DI_`, `WebApi_`).

2. **Tagging and Indexing:**  
   - Update the master index table when adding or modifying projects.
   - Use descriptive keywords that reflect the technology, patterns, and purpose.

3. **Documentation:**  
   - Include a README in each project folder that details its purpose, setup instructions, and any dependencies.
   - Maintain a changelog if significant updates are made.

4. **Directory Placement:**  
   - Place new projects in the appropriate subdirectory based on their primary functionality.
   - If a project fits multiple categories, choose the one that best reflects its core purpose and update the master index accordingly.


## Adding New Projects

When adding a new project:
- **Determine the Category:** Decide where the project best fits (e.g., API, DataAccess, Utilities).
- **Update the Index:** Add a new entry to the Master Index with the project name, category, relevant keywords, and a short description.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Follow the established naming and documentation conventions.
